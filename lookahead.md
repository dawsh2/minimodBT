# Lookahead Bias in the Current Regime Filter Implementation

## The Problem

Your current `basic_volatility_regime_filter` implementation potentially introduces lookahead bias in your trading system. Lookahead bias occurs when your model unknowingly uses information that wouldn't have been available at the time a trading decision is made.

## Sources of Lookahead Bias

Examining your current implementation reveals several sources of potential lookahead bias:

### 1. Percentile-Based Thresholds

```python
if method == 'percentile':
    # Use percentile-based regime splitting
    vol_low = volatility.quantile(0.25)
    vol_high = volatility.quantile(0.75)
```

This code calculates percentiles using the **entire dataset's distribution**, including future data that wouldn't be available during actual trading. This is why you're seeing the suspiciously perfect 50%/25%/25% distribution in your regimes.

### 2. No Shifting in Regime Assignment

```python
# Classify regimes
regime_series = pd.Series(0, index=df.index)
regime_series[volatility <= vol_low] = 1
regime_series[volatility >= vol_high] = 2
```

The regime is being determined using same-day volatility without shifting, meaning your system knows the volatility of day T when making a decision for day T. In reality, you'd only know the volatility up to day T-1.

### 3. No Time Alignment in Data Splitting

```python
# Split data by regimes
regime_splits = {}
for regime in regime_series.unique():
    regime_mask = regime_series == regime
    regime_data = df[regime_mask].copy()
```

When splitting the data by regimes, the code doesn't ensure that only past regime information is used for current trading decisions.

## Impact on System Performance

These lookahead bias issues could lead to:

1. **Overly optimistic backtest results**: Your system appears to perform better than it would in real trading.
2. **False confidence in regime-based optimization**: If regimes are determined with future knowledge, optimization may not be meaningful.
3. **Strategy failure in live trading**: A strategy developed with lookahead bias often performs poorly when deployed.

## The Fix: Bias-Free Regime Detection

To address these issues, implement these fixes:

### 1. Use Expanding Windows for Thresholds

```python
# Instead of full-sample quantiles
vol_low = volatility.expanding(min_periods=60).quantile(0.25).shift(1)
vol_high = volatility.expanding(min_periods=60).quantile(0.75).shift(1)
```

This uses only data available up to each point, with a one-day shift to ensure you're not using same-day information.

### 2. Adaptive Method with Proper Shifting

```python
# For adaptive thresholds
rolling_vol_baseline = volatility.rolling(lookback, min_periods=60).mean().shift(1)
vol_low = rolling_vol_baseline * low_multiplier
vol_high = rolling_vol_baseline * high_multiplier
```

The shift ensures the baseline only uses past data for threshold determination.

### 3. Shift the Final Regime Series

```python
# Final step in regime determination
regime_series = regime_series.shift(1).fillna(0).astype(int)
```

This critical step ensures you're only using past regime information for current trading decisions.

## Complete Bias-Free Implementation

Here's a bias-free implementation of the basic volatility regime filter:

```python
def bias_free_volatility_regime_filter(df, method='adaptive', lookback=252, threshold_multipliers=(0.7, 1.3)):
    """
    Detect market regimes based on price volatility WITHOUT lookahead bias.
    """
    # Calculate daily returns
    returns = np.log(df.Close / df.Close.shift(1))
    
    # Calculate rolling volatility (
